# Odin-Project


This contains individual Projects from ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
Most of the projects in this folder are from the "Ruby" curriculum.

Other larger Rails based projects will be kept in their own repository. Not all Ruby projects are in this repository. For example it is missing:

 - Mastermind
 - Connect 4
 - The Final Chess Project

The first two were skipped simply since those sections were serving as a refresher for me and I was more focused on moving into the later sections. I also skipped the chess project due to time constraints, as my main purpose was of this course was to learn Rails + Expanding my JavaScript knowledge. The Chess project didn't teach new concepts (Although I may revisit it for fun some time however).
